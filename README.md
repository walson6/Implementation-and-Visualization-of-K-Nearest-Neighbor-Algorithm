### Project Title: Implementation and Visualization of K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

**Objective:**  
To understand the implementation of the K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and learn the basics of the scikit-learn (sklearn) library.

**Implementation:**  
- Created training and testing datasets with 40 and 500 points respectively using NumPy.
- Implemented the L2 distance function to calculate the Euclidean distance between data samples.
- Developed the `knn_classifier_predict` function to predict labels for test points by finding the k nearest neighbors and selecting the most common label.
- Implemented the `knn_regressor_predict` function to predict values for test points based on the mean of the k nearest neighbors' labels.

**Visualization:**  
- Utilized Matplotlib to plot the training data and the predicted values, providing a clear visual representation of the KNN regression results.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Proficiency in Python programming.
- Understanding of machine learning concepts, specifically the KNN algorithm.
- Experience with data manipulation and analysis using NumPy.
- Knowledge of data visualization techniques using Matplotlib.
- Familiarity with the scikit-learn library.

**Tools and Libraries Used:**  
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
